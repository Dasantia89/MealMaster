# Group Project #1 - MealMaster
Contributors: David Santiago, Erin Polhemus, Austin Oler and Nainoa Dinson

## Description

Group Project #1 involved the creation of an interactive application that meets the following criteria:
  - Is interactive (i.e. accepts and responds to user input)
  - Uses at least two server-side APIs
  - Uses Modals instead of alerts, confirmations, or prompts
  - Uses Client-Side storage to store persistent data
  - Is responsive
  - Has a polished UI
  - And is deployed to GitHub Pages
    
Our group elected to develop an application (which we refer to as "MealMaster") that allows the user search for recipes based on ingredients, or by specifying a particular food by name; the user is then presented with a list of recipes that meets the criteria that was provided (including images of the recipe, preparation instructions, and a list of the required ingredients, and the user is then given the ability to track those recipes and the ingredients they require, and to generate a PDF containing the required ingredients.

We met the Project Requirements by ensuring the following:
  - The application accepts and responds to user input, allowing the user to select from a list of common ingredients, or to specify the name of a particular dish
  - The application uses two different server-side APIs:
    -- Spoonacular as the data source for the recipes that are displayed
    -- html2pdf to convert the shopping list of saved ingredients to a PDF file
  - Client-side storage utilizes localstorage within the browser to save the recipes and/or the list of ingredients that user has elected to save
  - The application has been succesfully deployed to GitHub Pages
  - And ensuring that we adhered to quality coding standards and maintained an organized repository
